I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care. 

If you obey all the rules you miss all the fun. 

We learned about honesty and integrity - that the truth matters... that you don't take shortcuts or play by your own set of rules... and success doesn't count unless you earn it fair and square. 

There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds. 

Rules like 'don't wear white after Labor Day' or 'shoes matching the handbag' are antiquated. Modern women should feel free to experiment. 

Feelings of worth can flourish only in an atmosphere where individual differences are appreciated, mistakes are tolerated, communication is open, and rules are flexible - the kind of atmosphere that is found in a nurturing family. 

If I'd observed all the rules, I'd never have got anywhere.
